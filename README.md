# YieldMaster Solutions:  Biological Program Calculator

This web-based tool helps Legend Seed and YMS representatives and dealers work with growers to calculate the necessary amounts and costs of our biological products.  

Calculations are based upon inputs from users including the particular crop being grown, the seeding rate (entered as either seeds/acre, lbs/acre, or bu/acre), and the particular products needed.
